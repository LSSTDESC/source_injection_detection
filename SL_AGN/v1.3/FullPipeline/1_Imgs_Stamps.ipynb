Therefore, if we want our stamps to remain consistent in their orientation between both products, we must rotate stamps injected into a `visit_image` relative to the `deep_coadd`."

We want each `visit_image` to contain many injected instances of the same stamp system at the same time. Then for every other visit, we'll change which time index we use to simulate observing the same SL-AGN system at multiple times over many captures. So we'll inject copies of `visit_0` with `system_A_0.fits` for each system A, and each `visit_1` we inject will use `system_A_1.fits`, and so on for each visit and each SL-AGN system.\n",
