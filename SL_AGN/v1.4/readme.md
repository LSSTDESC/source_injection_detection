Update from Dhruv's code for DP1 source injection of lensed AGN.

Large scale source injection for multiple exposures and bands.

Consider fields: ECDFS, low Galactic latitude, and maybe low ecliptic latitude / EDFS.

Improve reprocessing steps for getting the source catalog (not source table) from single exposures for AL input.

To test the code, run through step0, step1, step2.
