# source_injection_detection

This repo is for storing code for source injection and image reprocessing, primarily on Rubin images and using the LSST Science Pipelines.  

Example DESC projects using this repo include:
* "The First Cut: Developing the Initial Catalog Query for LSST Lensed AGNs".

The idea is to collect notebooks and scripts in one place so they can be picked up, adapted and re-used in new science cases.

Organization is roughly one folder per science case.
* `SL_AGN` This folder stores the code for the source injection of strongly lensed AGN in LSST. Go to the folder for one version of the code and test it (`bash run.sh`). (See Dhruv 's development of the code for DP1 [here](https://github.com/DhruvSharmaUIUC/source_injection_detection/tree/main/SL_AGN/v1.2), currently still working on merging.)
